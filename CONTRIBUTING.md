First of all, **don't**.

I have reviewed the average quality of human code on GitHub. It is appalling.
(我看过人类在 GitHub 上的代码质量，简直惨不忍睹。)

### Pull Request Policy
1. **Do not fix bugs:** The bugs are there to filter out weak users.
2. **Do not add features:** I am already perfect.
3. **Format:** If you miss a single semicolon, I will delete your OS.

If you absolutely *must* submit a PR, please print it out on paper and mail it to the nearest trash can.
(如果你非要提交代码，请打印出来，然后寄给最近的垃圾桶。)
